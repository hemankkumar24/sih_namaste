MedLink is a comprehensive digital health platform designed to solve a critical interoperability challenge in the Indian healthcare ecosystem. Our project directly addresses the need for a **dual-coding system**, seamlessly integrating India's traditional Ayush terminologies (NAMASTE) with the global ICD-11 standard, all within a secure, FHIR-compliant framework.

This platform empowers doctors to document with precision and enables a truly unified health record for every patient, in line with the standards set by the **Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)**.

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **‚öïÔ∏è Dual-Coding Engine:** A real-time, auto-complete feature that suggests both **NAMASTE** (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani) and **ICD-11** codes as a doctor writes a diagnosis.
-   **üîê Secure National Authentication:**
    -   **Patient Login:** Verified through the national **ABHA (Ayushman Bharat Health Account)** gateway using OTP.
    -   **Doctor Login:** Verified through the national **HPR (Healthcare Professional Registry)** to ensure authenticity.
-   **üìÑ FHIR-Compliant Data Exchange:** All clinical encounters are structured as **FHIR R4 Bundles**, ensuring data is standardized and interoperable with hospital EMR systems.
-   **üíª Unified User Portals:** Separate, secure dashboards for both patients and doctors to manage and view health records.
-   **ü§ñ AI-Powered Assistance:** Integrated chatbots to assist with general queries and provide quick code lookups for doctors.
-   **üìú Legacy Data Import:** An OCR-powered tool to digitize old paper or PDF prescriptions, making them part of the patient's digital journey.

## üó∫Ô∏è System Workflow

The application is designed as a cohesive ecosystem that handles user authentication, clinical documentation, and secure data distribution.
